# Write a program to sort a stack in ascending order. You should not make any assump- tions about how the stack is implemented. The following are the only functions that should be used to write this program: push | pop | peek | isEmpty.

=begin

push pop, peek = [-1], empty?
merge sort n log n
n space for new array
=end

# def sort_stack stack
#   stack.each_index do |idx|
#     stack.peek
#   end
# end

  def outer
